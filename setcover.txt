The new score function takes into account various factors such as the possibility of rounding down or up, the fractional part of the solution value, the number of locks for rounding, the objective function value, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost values, the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and the type of variable (binary or not).

score:178.64798568668328
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1) If it is possible to round down and stay feasible (mayrounddown), it should be penalized because it means we need more exploration. The same applies for rounding up (mayroundup).

2) The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) is considered in the score. A larger fractional part indicates a higher score.

3) The solution value in the LP relaxation (candsol) is also considered. A higher value indicates a higher score.

4) The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) of a special type is taken into account. A higher number of locks indicates a lower score.

5) The objective function value (obj) and its Euclidean norm (objnorm) contribute to the score. A higher objective function value and/or norm indicate a higher score.

6) The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) is included in the score. Higher pseudo cost values indicate a higher score.

7) The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is considered. If the root relaxation is not yet completely solved, a zero is returned and it is penalized in the score.

8) The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) determines the score. A higher number of nonzeros indicates a higher score.

9) Finally, if the variable is of binary type (isBinary), it is considered to determine the score and rounding direction.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates a score for each variable and determines whether to round the variable up or down.

score:31.234478484297192
<start_des>
The new score function's logic is to prioritize variables that have a higher fractional part of the solution value and a higher objective function value. It also takes into consideration whether the variable can be rounded down or up without violating feasibility and penalizes such variables. Additionally, it considers the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up, as well as the variable's pseudo cost values, objective function vector norm, and the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation.

The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac), multiplied by a factor of 1 if the variable can be rounded up (mayroundup=True) or -1 if it can be rounded down (mayrounddown=True). This ensures that variables that can be rounded up are favored over those that can be rounded down.

The score is then multiplied by the objective function value (obj) and divided by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). This accounts for the importance of the variable in achieving the overall optimization objective.

The score is further adjusted based on the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown), rounding up (nlocksup), the variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup), and the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz). These factors either increase or decrease the score based on their values.

Finally, the score is multiplied by the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). If the root relaxation is not yet completely solved, the score remains unchanged.

The function outputs the calculated score and a boolean value (roundup) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or not (False).

score:6.310834702619473
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account various features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. It penalizes variables that may need more exploration by rounding down/up and staying feasible. The score is based on the fractional part of the solution value, solution value in LP relaxation, number of locks for rounding down/up, objective function value, objective function's Euclidean norm, pseudo cost values for rounding down/up, solution value in the last root node's relaxation, number of nonzero entries, and the binary nature of the variable. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize the score as the fractional part of the solution value.
2. If rounding down is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by subtracting a small value from the score.
3. If rounding up is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by adding a small value to the score.
4. If the variable is binary, multiply the score by a factor depending on the fractionality of the solution value.
5. If the variable has a higher objective function value, multiply the score by a factor depending on the objective function's Euclidean norm.
6. If taking into account the pseudo cost values, adjust the score by multiplying it by a factor depending on the change in the variable's LP value.
7. If the variable has a nonzero solution value in the last root node's relaxation, multiply the score by a factor depending on the number of nonzero entries.
8. Return the final score and determine the rounding direction based on the sign of the score.

Additionally, the function considers the objective function value, its Euclidean norm, the solution value in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and the variable type (binary or not).

The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account the fractional part of the solution value of the variable 'candsfrac' and sets the rounding direction based on this value. If the fractional part is higher, the function sets 'roundup' as True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. The score is based solely on the 'candsfrac' value, with higher fractional values leading to a higher score.

score:3.8479471683753017
<start_des>
The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 
1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

4) The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) of a special type is taken into account. A higher number of locks indicates a lower score.

5) The objective function value (obj) and its Euclidean norm (objnorm) contribute to the score. A higher objective function value and/or norm indicate a higher score.

6) The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) is included in the score. Higher pseudo cost values indicate a higher score.

7) The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is considered. If the root relaxation is not yet completely solved, a zero is returned and it is penalized in the score.

It also takes into consideration the number of nonzero entries in the variable and whether the variable is of binary type.

score:6.310834702619473
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account various features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. It penalizes variables that may need more exploration by rounding down/up and staying feasible. The score is based on the fractional part of the solution value, solution value in LP relaxation, number of locks for rounding down/up, objective function value, objective function's Euclidean norm, pseudo cost values for rounding down/up, solution value in the last root node's relaxation, number of nonzero entries, and the binary nature of the variable. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize the score as the fractional part of the solution value.
2. If rounding down is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by subtracting a small value from the score.
3. If rounding up is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by adding a small value to the score.
4. If the variable is binary, multiply the score by a factor depending on the fractionality of the solution value.
5. If the variable has a higher objective function value, multiply the score by a factor depending on the objective function's Euclidean norm.
6. If taking into account the pseudo cost values, adjust the score by multiplying it by a factor depending on the change in the variable's LP value.
7. If the variable has a nonzero solution value in the last root node's relaxation, multiply the score by a factor depending on the number of nonzero entries.
8. Return the final score and determine the rounding direction based on the sign of the score.

The new score function first considers the fractional part of the variable's solution value, as this indicates the potential impact of rounding on the feasibility. The function also takes into account the number of locks for rounding down and up, as well as the pseudo cost values for the changes in the variable's LP value. Additionally, the function considers the objective function value, its Euclidean norm, the solution value in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and the variable type (binary or not). Based on these features, the function calculates the variable's score and determines whether to round the variable up or down.

The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account the fractional part of the solution value of the variable 'candsfrac' and sets the rounding direction based on this value. If the fractional part is higher, the function sets 'roundup' as True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. The score is based solely on the 'candsfrac' value, with higher fractional values leading to a higher score.

-------------------
score:3.8479471683753017
<start_des>
The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 
1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

score:31.234478484297192
<start_des>
The new score function's logic is to prioritize variables that have a higher fractional part of the solution value and a higher objective function value. It also takes into consideration whether the variable can be rounded down or up without violating feasibility and penalizes such variables. Additionally, it considers the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up, as well as the variable's pseudo cost values, objective function vector norm, and the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation.

The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac), multiplied by a factor of 1 if the variable can be rounded up (mayroundup=True) or -1 if it can be rounded down (mayrounddown=True). This ensures that variables that can be rounded up are favored over those that can be rounded down.

The score is then multiplied by the objective function value (obj) and divided by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). This accounts for the importance of the variable in achieving the overall optimization objective.

The score is further adjusted based on the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown), rounding up (nlocksup), the variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup), and the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz). These factors either increase or decrease the score based on their values.

Finally, the score is multiplied by the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). If the root relaxation is not yet completely solved, the score remains unchanged.

The function outputs the calculated score and a boolean value (roundup) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or not (False).

score:7.699358487854178
<start_des>
The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account multiple factors to calculate the variable's score and determine the rounding direction. 

The score calculation is based on the following features:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up and stay feasible ('mayrounddown' and 'mayroundup' are both False), the score is penalized with a negative value.

2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable ('candsfrac') is added to the score. Higher fractional values contribute to a higher score.

3. The solution value of the variable in LP relaxation ('candsol') is added to the score. Higher solution values contribute to a higher score.

4. The number of locks for rounding down and rounding up ('nlocksdown' and 'nlocksup') are subtracted from the score. Higher numbers of locks lead to a lower score.

5. The objective function value of the variable ('obj') is added to the score. Higher objective function values contribute to a higher score.

6. The Euclidean norm of the objective function vector ('objnorm') is added to the score. Higher norm values contribute to a higher score.

7. The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down and rounding up ('pscostdown' and 'pscostup') are subtracted from the score. Higher pseudo cost values lead to a lower score.

8. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation ('rootsolval') is added to the score. Higher root solution values contribute to a higher score.

9. The number of nonzero entries in the variable ('nNonz') is added to the score. Higher numbers of non-zero entries contribute to a higher score.

10. If the variable is of binary type ('isBinary' is True), the score is penalized with a negative value.

Based on the value of 'candsfrac', the rounding direction ('roundup') is determined. If 'candsfrac' is greater than 0.5, 'roundup' is set to True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. Otherwise, 'roundup' is set to False, indicating that the variable should be rounded down.

The final score and rounding direction are returned by the function.

The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize the score as the fractional part of the solution value.
2. If rounding down is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by subtracting a small value from the score.

7. If the variable has a nonzero solution value in the last root node's relaxation, multiply the score by a factor depending on the number of nonzero entries.

score:7.699358487854178
<start_des>
The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account multiple factors to calculate the variable's score and determine the rounding direction. 

The score calculation is based on the following features:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up and stay feasible ('mayrounddown' and 'mayroundup' are both False), the score is penalized with a negative value.

2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable ('candsfrac') is added to the score. Higher fractional values contribute to a higher score.

3. The solution value of the variable in LP relaxation ('candsol') is added to the score. Higher solution values contribute to a higher score.

4. The number of locks for rounding down and rounding up ('nlocksdown' and 'nlocksup') are subtracted from the score. Higher numbers of locks lead to a lower score.

5. The objective function value of the variable ('obj') is added to the score. Higher objective function values contribute to a higher score.

6. The Euclidean norm of the objective function vector ('objnorm') is added to the score. Higher norm values contribute to a higher score.

7. The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down and rounding up ('pscostdown' and 'pscostup') are subtracted from the score. Higher pseudo cost values lead to a lower score.

8. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation ('rootsolval') is added to the score. Higher root solution values contribute to a higher score.

9. The number of nonzero entries in the variable ('nNonz') is added to the score. Higher numbers of non-zero entries contribute to a higher score.

10. If the variable is of binary type ('isBinary' is True), the score is penalized with a negative value.

Based on the value of 'candsfrac', the rounding direction ('roundup') is determined. If 'candsfrac' is greater than 0.5, 'roundup' is set to True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. Otherwise, 'roundup' is set to False, indicating that the variable should be rounded down.

The final score and rounding direction are returned by the function.

score:6.310834702619473
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account various features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. It penalizes variables that may need more exploration by rounding down/up and staying feasible. The score is based on the fractional part of the solution value, solution value in LP relaxation, number of locks for rounding down/up, objective function value, objective function's Euclidean norm, pseudo cost values for rounding down/up, solution value in the last root node's relaxation, number of nonzero entries, and the binary nature of the variable. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize the score as the fractional part of the solution value.
2. If rounding down is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by subtracting a small value from the score.
3. If rounding up is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by adding a small value to the score.
4. If the variable is binary, multiply the score by a factor depending on the fractionality of the solution value.
5. If the variable has a higher objective function value, multiply the score by a factor depending on the objective function's Euclidean norm.
6. If taking into account the pseudo cost values, adjust the score by multiplying it by a factor depending on the change in the variable's LP value.
7. If the variable has a nonzero solution value in the last root node's relaxation, multiply the score by a factor depending on the number of nonzero entries.
8. Return the final score and determine the rounding direction based on the sign of the score.

Additionally, the function considers the objective function value, its Euclidean norm, the solution value in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and the variable type (binary or not).

score:3.8479471683753017
<start_des>
The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 
1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account multiple factors to calculate the variable's score and determine the rounding direction. 

The score calculation is based on the following features:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up and stay feasible ('mayrounddown' and 'mayroundup' are both False), the score is penalized with a negative value.

2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable ('candsfrac') is added to the score. Higher fractional values contribute to a higher score.

3. The solution value of the variable in LP relaxation ('candsol') is added to the score. Higher solution values contribute to a higher score.

4. The number of locks for rounding down and rounding up ('nlocksdown' and 'nlocksup') are subtracted from the score. Higher numbers of locks lead to a lower score.

5. The objective function value of the variable ('obj') is added to the score. Higher objective function values contribute to a higher score.

6. The Euclidean norm of the objective function vector ('objnorm') is added to the score. Higher norm values contribute to a higher score.

7. The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down and rounding up ('pscostdown' and 'pscostup') are subtracted from the score. Higher pseudo cost values lead to a lower score.

8. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation ('rootsolval') is added to the score. Higher root solution values contribute to a higher score.

9. The number of nonzero entries in the variable ('nNonz') is added to the score. Higher numbers of non-zero entries contribute to a higher score.

10. If the variable is of binary type ('isBinary' is True), the score is penalized with a negative value.

Based on the value of 'candsfrac', the rounding direction ('roundup') is determined. If 'candsfrac' is greater than 0.5, 'roundup' is set to True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. Otherwise, 'roundup' is set to False, indicating that the variable should be rounded down.

The final score and rounding direction are returned by the function.

1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

The new score function's logic is to combine the features from the two given score functions to create a comprehensive scoring mechanism. It prioritizes variables with a higher fractional part of the solution value and a higher objective function value while penalizing variables that can be rounded down or up without violating feasibility. It also considers the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up, as well as the variable's pseudo cost values, objective function vector norm, the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is binary.

The score is calculated based on the combination of these features and decides whether the variable should be rounded up to maximize the score.

score:7.699358487854178
<start_des>
The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account multiple factors to calculate the variable's score and determine the rounding direction. 

The score calculation is based on the following features:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up and stay feasible ('mayrounddown' and 'mayroundup' are both False), the score is penalized with a negative value.

2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable ('candsfrac') is added to the score. Higher fractional values contribute to a higher score.

3. The solution value of the variable in LP relaxation ('candsol') is added to the score. Higher solution values contribute to a higher score.

4. The number of locks for rounding down and rounding up ('nlocksdown' and 'nlocksup') are subtracted from the score. Higher numbers of locks lead to a lower score.

5. The objective function value of the variable ('obj') is added to the score. Higher objective function values contribute to a higher score.

6. The Euclidean norm of the objective function vector ('objnorm') is added to the score. Higher norm values contribute to a higher score.

7. The variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down and rounding up ('pscostdown' and 'pscostup') are subtracted from the score. Higher pseudo cost values lead to a lower score.

8. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation ('rootsolval') is added to the score. Higher root solution values contribute to a higher score.

9. The number of nonzero entries in the variable ('nNonz') is added to the score. Higher numbers of non-zero entries contribute to a higher score.

10. If the variable is of binary type ('isBinary' is True), the score is penalized with a negative value.

Based on the value of 'candsfrac', the rounding direction ('roundup') is determined. If 'candsfrac' is greater than 0.5, 'roundup' is set to True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. Otherwise, 'roundup' is set to False, indicating that the variable should be rounded down.

The final score and rounding direction are returned by the function.

score:6.310834702619473
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account various features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. It penalizes variables that may need more exploration by rounding down/up and staying feasible. The score is based on the fractional part of the solution value, solution value in LP relaxation, number of locks for rounding down/up, objective function value, objective function's Euclidean norm, pseudo cost values for rounding down/up, solution value in the last root node's relaxation, number of nonzero entries, and the binary nature of the variable. The logic is as follows:
1. Initialize the score as the fractional part of the solution value.
2. If rounding down is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by subtracting a small value from the score.
3. If rounding up is not possible or may affect feasibility, penalize the variable by adding a small value to the score.
4. If the variable is binary, multiply the score by a factor depending on the fractionality of the solution value.
5. If the variable has a higher objective function value, multiply the score by a factor depending on the objective function's Euclidean norm.
6. If taking into account the pseudo cost values, adjust the score by multiplying it by a factor depending on the change in the variable's LP value.
7. If the variable has a nonzero solution value in the last root node's relaxation, multiply the score by a factor depending on the number of nonzero entries.
8. Return the final score and determine the rounding direction based on the sign of the score.

<start_des>
The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 
1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

The code for the new score function is as follows:

The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction.

Similarly, it penalizes the possibility of rounding the variable up and staying feasible. The initial score is set to the fractional part of the solution value. If the variable is of binary type, it prefers to round up. The function outputs the variable's score and the rounding direction based on these considerations.

The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account the fractional part of the solution value of the variable 'candsfrac' and sets the rounding direction based on this value.

The new score function's logic is to combine the features from the two given score functions to create a comprehensive scoring mechanism. It prioritizes variables with a higher fractional part of the solution value and a higher objective function value while penalizing variables that can be rounded down or up without violating feasibility. It also considers the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up, as well as the variable's pseudo cost values, objective function vector norm, the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is binary.

The score is calculated based on the combination of these features and decides whether the variable should be rounded up to maximize the score.

score:4.14306542740325
<start_des>
The new score function 'myheurdiving' takes into account the fractional part of the solution value of the variable 'candsfrac' and sets the rounding direction based on this value. If the fractional part is higher, the function sets 'roundup' as True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. The score is based solely on the 'candsfrac' value, with higher fractional values leading to a higher score.

score:3.8479471683753017
<start_des>
The new score function's logic takes into account several factors to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 
1. If it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown is True), then it should be penalized because we want to explore more options. Similarly, if it is possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup is True), it should also be penalized.
2. The fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) is used as the initial score. The larger the fractional part, the higher the score.
3. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary is True), we prefer rounding up (roundup is set to True) to encourage the variable to take its binary value. Otherwise, we set roundup to True initially, but this may be overridden later in the code if a better rounding direction is found.
4. The number of locks for rounding down/up of a special type (nlocksdown and nlocksup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
5. The objective function value of the variable (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) are not directly used in determining the score but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
6. The variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value (pscostdown and pscostup) are not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
7. The solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.
8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) is not used in determining the score directly but may be used for further exploration later in the code.

The code for the new score function is as follows:

The new score function's logic is to combine the features from the two given score functions to create a comprehensive scoring mechanism. It prioritizes variables with a higher fractional part of the solution value and a higher objective function value while penalizing variables that can be rounded down or up without violating feasibility. It also considers the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up, as well as the variable's pseudo cost values, objective function vector norm, the variable's solution in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is binary. The score is calculated based on the combination of these features and decides whether the variable should be rounded up to maximize the score.
