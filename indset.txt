score:14.715086996951044
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account various factors to determine the score of the variable and the corresponding rounding direction. Here is the logic of the score function:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown = False), penalize the score by subtracting a constant value.
2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup = False), penalize the score by subtracting a constant value.
3. Consider the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). The higher the fractional part, the higher the score.
4. Consider the difference between the current solution value and the LP relaxation solution value (candsol). If the difference is positive, indicating that rounding up would bring the solution value closer to the LP relaxation solution, increase the score. Otherwise, decrease the score.
5. Consider the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) of a special type. If both nlocksdown and nlocksup are non-zero, penalize the score by subtracting a constant value.
6. Consider the objective function value of the variable (obj). If the objective function value is positive, indicating a positive contribution to the objective, increase the score. Otherwise, decrease the score.
7. Consider the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). If objnorm is greater than a threshold value, increase the score.
8. Consider the variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup). Take the average of pscostdown and pscostup and add it to the score.
9. Consider the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). If rootsolval is non-zero, increase the score.
10. Consider the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz). If nNonz is greater than a threshold value, increase the score.
11. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary = True), increase the score.

The code for the score function is as follows:

The new score function takes into account the possibility of rounding down or up, the fractional part of the solution value, the number of locks for rounding down or up, the objective function value, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost value, the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is of binary type. The logic of the new score function is to prioritize variables with a higher fractional part, lower number of locks, and lower pseudo cost value.

<start_des>
The new score function will calculate the score of the variable based on the given features. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If the variable is not binary, penalize the score if rounding up or down is possible (mayroundup or mayrounddown is True). This is because we want to explore more and avoid early rounding.

2. Calculate the base score using the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). This will be the starting point for the variable's score.

3. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.

4. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

5. Adjust the score based on the pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

6. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

8. Finally, determine the rounding direction based on the score. Since we want a higher score, we set roundup to True.

The new score function is based on a combination of different features to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 

The logic of the score function is as follows:
1. If it is possible to round the variable down (mayrounddown = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
2. If it is possible to round the variable up (mayroundup = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
3. Add the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) to the score.

5. Add the objective function value of the variable (obj) to the score.
6. Add the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) to the score.
7. Add the variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) to the score.

<start_des>
The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

-------------------
score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

The new score function is based on a combination of different features to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. 

The logic of the score function is as follows:
1. If it is possible to round the variable down (mayrounddown = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
2. If it is possible to round the variable up (mayroundup = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
3. Add the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) to the score.
4. Add the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) as penalties.
5. Add the objective function value of the variable (obj) to the score.
6. Add the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) to the score.
7. Add the variable's pseudo cost value for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) to the score.
8. If there is a nonzero entry in the variable (nNonz > 0), add a bonus to the score.

<start_des>
The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

The new score function's logic is based on the given features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. The score is calculated using the fractional part of the solution value, where a higher fractional part indicates a higher score. The rounding direction is determined by setting the roundup variable to True. This means that the variable should be rounded up. The function returns the score and roundup values.

It prioritizes variables with a larger fractional part and penalizes those with more locks for rounding, while also considering the objective function value, pseudo cost, and number of nonzero entries.

score:1.1514984838140827

The new score function will calculate the score of the variable based on the given features. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If the variable is not binary, penalize the score if rounding up or down is possible (mayroundup or mayrounddown is True). This is because we want to explore more and avoid early rounding.

2. Calculate the base score using the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). This will be the starting point for the variable's score.

3. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.

4. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

5. Adjust the score based on the pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

6. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

8. Finally, determine the rounding direction based on the score. Since we want a higher score, we set roundup to True.

score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

score:11.940183578267746
<start_des>
The new score function's logic is based on the given features to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. The score is calculated using the fractional part of the solution value, where a higher fractional part indicates a higher score. The rounding direction is determined by setting the roundup variable to True. This means that the variable should be rounded up. The function returns the score and roundup values.

The code for the score function 'myheurdiving' is as follows:

-------------------
score:4.503379671853461

The score function takes into account the fractional part of the solution value, the possibility of rounding down or up, the number of locks for rounding down or up, the objective function value, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost value, the solution value in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and the type of variable (binary or not). It prioritizes variables with a larger fractional part and penalizes those with more locks for rounding, while also considering the objective function value, pseudo cost, and number of nonzero entries.

score:1.1514984838140827
<start_des>
The new score function will calculate the score of the variable based on the given features. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If the variable is not binary, penalize the score if rounding up or down is possible (mayroundup or mayrounddown is True). This is because we want to explore more and avoid early rounding.

2. Calculate the base score using the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). This will be the starting point for the variable's score.

3. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.

4. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

5. Adjust the score based on the pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

6. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

8. Finally, determine the rounding direction based on the score. Since we want a higher score, we set roundup to True.

6. Adjust the score based on the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objective function vector norms imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. Adjust the score based on the variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

8. Adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

9. Finally, set the rounding direction to round up by default (roundup = True).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

It prioritizes variables with a larger fractional part and penalizes those with more locks for rounding, while also considering the objective function value, pseudo cost, and number of nonzero entries. It will round up the variable if the fractional part of the solution value is greater than the LP solution value.

The new score function will calculate the score of the variable based on the given features. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If the variable is not binary, penalize the score if rounding up or down is possible (mayroundup or mayrounddown is True). This is because we want to explore more and avoid early rounding.

2. Calculate the base score using the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). This will be the starting point for the variable's score.

3. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.

4. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

5. Adjust the score based on the pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

6. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

8. Finally, determine the rounding direction based on the score. Since we want a higher score, we set roundup to True.

The new score function's logic is as follows:

1. If it is possible to round the variable down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown or mayroundup is True), penalize the score by subtracting 0.1. This is because we want to explore more and avoid early rounding.

2. Calculate the base score using the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac).

3. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.

4. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

5. Adjust the score based on the objective function value of the variable (obj). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

6. Adjust the score based on the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objective function vector norms imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

7. Adjust the score based on the variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

8. Adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

9. Finally, set the rounding direction to round up by default (roundup = True).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

11. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.
12. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

<start_des>
The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

-------------------
score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

<start_des>
The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

The new score function's logic is as follows:

1. If it is possible to round the variable down (mayrounddown = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
2. If it is possible to round the variable up (mayroundup = True), subtract a penalty to prioritize exploration.
3. Add the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac) to the score.
4. Subtract a penalty based on the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup), scaled by a factor of 0.1.
5. Subtract a penalty based on the pseudo cost values of rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup), scaled by a factor of 0.1.
6. Add the variable's objective function value (obj) to the score.
7. Add the normalized objective function value (objnorm) to the score.
8. If there is a nonzero entry in the variable (nNonz > 0), subtract a penalty of 0.05.
9. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary = True), subtract a penalty of 0.05.
10. If the absolute difference between candsfrac and 0.5 is less than 0.15, add a bonus of 0.2 to the score.
11. Finally, specify the rounding direction as roundup = True.

The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

-------------------
score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

-------------------
score:0.6158131677668538
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

11. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.
12. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.

14. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.
15. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

11. If the variable is binary, add a penalty based on the number of non-zero entries in the variable (nNonz). More non-zero entries imply a more complex variable, so we want to penalize such variables.
12. Adjust the score based on the number of locks for rounding down and rounding up (nlocksdown and nlocksup). Higher lock counts imply a more constrained variable, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.
13. Adjust the score based on the pseudo cost values for rounding down and rounding up (pscostdown and pscostup). Higher pseudo cost values imply a higher cost for rounding, so we want to reduce the score for such variables.
14. Adjust the score based on the normalized objective function value (objnorm). Higher objective function values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.
15. If the variable is binary, adjust the score based on the solution value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval). Higher solution values imply a higher priority, so we want to increase the score for such variables.

<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.

<start_des>
The score function's logic is to calculate the score of each variable based on the given features. The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value of the variable. In addition, the function determines the rounding direction based on the given features. The rounding direction is set to round up by default, but can be changed to round down if it is possible to round the variable down and stay feasible. 

The score function penalizes variables that have the possibility to be rounded down or up and stay feasible (mayrounddown and mayroundup). It also considers the number of locks for rounding down/up (nlocksdown and nlocksup), the objective function value of the variable (obj), the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm), the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down/up (pscostdown and pscostup), the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval), the number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz), and whether the variable is binary (isBinary).

The function returns the score (float) indicating the variable's score, where a higher score is better. It also returns the rounding direction (bool) indicating whether the variable should be rounded up (True) or down (False).

The new score function combines the features of two existing score functions to determine the variable's score and rounding direction. The logic of the score function is to prioritize exploration by penalizing the possibility of rounding the variable down or up and stay feasible. It considers the fractional part of the solution value of the variable, the number of locks for rounding down/up, the objective function value, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost values, the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is of binary type. It also calculates the rounding direction based on the possibility of rounding down and staying feasible.

score:1.2597267563328898
<start_des>
The new score function is based on a combination of different factors that allow for a more informed decision on the rounding direction. The objective is to maximize the score, indicating a more favorable variable for rounding. The logic of the score function is as follows:

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down and stay feasible (mayrounddown=False), the score is penalized by adding a large negative constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded down.

2. If it is not possible to round the variable up and stay feasible (mayroundup=False), the score is penalized by subtracting a large positive constant. This discourages exploration of variables that cannot be rounded up.

3. The score is increased by the fractional part of the solution value of the variable (candsfrac). Higher fractional values indicate a stronger potential for rounding.

4. The score is increased by the number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup). Higher lock counts indicate a higher willingness to round in a particular direction.

5. The score is increased by the objective function value (obj). Higher obj values indicate a variable that contributes more to the overall objective.

6. The score is increased by the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm). Higher objnorm values indicate a variable that has a stronger impact on the overall objective.

7. If the variable is of binary type (isBinary=True), the score is further increased by a small positive constant. This encourages exploration of binary variables.

8. If the variable is not of binary type (isBinary=False) and has a non-zero value (nNonz > 0), the score is decreased by a small negative constant. This discourages exploration of non-binary variables with non-zero values.

9. If the variable's pseudo cost for rounding down (pscostdown) is higher than its pseudo cost for rounding up (pscostup), the round direction is set to round up (roundup=True) and vice versa.

The resulting score and rounding direction are returned as output from the score function.
