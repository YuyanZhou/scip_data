score:1000000000.0
<start_des>
The score function first considers the fractional part of the variable value, as variables with higher fractional parts are more likely to benefit from rounding. It then considers the possibility of rounding down and up, penalizing those variables as we need to explore more. Additionally, the function takes into account the objective function value, the number of locks for rounding down and up, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost values, the solution of the variable in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is of binary type. Based on these features, the function calculates a score and decides whether to round up or down.

The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction of a variable. The score function considers whether it is possible to round the variable down or up and still be feasible, penalizing variables that allow for more exploration. It also considers the fractional part of the solution value, the solution value in the LP relaxation, the number of locks for rounding down or up of a special type, the objective function value, the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector, the variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down or up, the solution value in the last root node's relaxation, the number of nonzero entries in the variable, and whether the variable is of binary type.

The score is calculated as the fractional part of the solution value, represented by 'candsfrac'. The rounding direction, represented by 'roundup', is initially set to True, indicating that the variable should be rounded up. The score and rounding direction are then returned as outputs.

This simple score function can be customized and expanded upon to incorporate additional features and heuristics as needed.

The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

<start_des>
The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

<start_des>
The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

score:1.052690400282566
<start_des>
The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

The new score function takes into account several factors to determine the score and rounding direction for each variable. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it should be penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

The new score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable based on the given features. 

1. If it is not possible to round the variable down or up without violating feasibility (mayrounddown=false or mayroundup=false), the variable is penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

2. The fractional part of the solution value (candsfrac) indicates how close the variable is to an integer solution. The closer the variable is to being an integer, the higher the score should be. 

3. The solution value in the LP relaxation solution (candsol) provides additional information about the variable's current value. The score should be higher if the variable is already close to an integer value.

4. The number of locks for rounding down (nlocksdown) and rounding up (nlocksup) indicates how many constraints would be violated if the variable is rounded in each direction. A high number of locks means it is more difficult to round the variable in that direction, and the score should be lower.

5. The objective function value (obj) and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector (objnorm) provide information about the importance of the variable in achieving the optimal objective value. The higher the objective function value and the objective norm, the higher the score should be.

6. The variable's pseudo cost values for rounding down (pscostdown) and rounding up (pscostup) indicate the impact of rounding the variable in each direction on the solution. A high pseudo cost value means that rounding the variable in that direction will have a significant impact on the solution, and the score should be higher for that direction.

7. The value of the variable in the last root node's relaxation (rootsolval) provides information about the variable's initial value. If the value is close to an integer, the score should be higher.

8. The number of nonzero entries in the variable (nNonz) indicates the sparsity of the variable. If the variable has a high number of nonzero entries, the score should be higher.

9. If the variable is binary (isBinary=true), it is penalized by subtracting a constant value from the score.

Based on these factors, the score function calculates the score and rounding direction for each variable.

- It increases the score based on the values of obj and objnorm, which represent the objective function value and the Euclidean norm of the objective function vector.
- It increases the score based on the values of pscostdown and pscostup, which represent the variable's pseudo cost value for the given change of the variable's LP value.
- It increases the score if the rootsolval is close to an integer by calculating the absolute difference between rootsolval and its rounded value.
- It increases the score based on the value of nNonz, which represents the number of nonzero entries in the variable.
- If the variable is binary (isBinary is True), it penalizes the score by subtracting 0.5.

- Finally, it determines the rounding direction by setting roundup to True if candsfrac is greater than or equal to 0.5.

The corresponding Python code for the new score function is:
